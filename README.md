## Random Quote Generator using vanilla JS

Personally selected random quotes stored in arrays. Also using random backgrounds stored on cloudinary.


### Usage

1. Click quote to get a random quote.

2. Tweet the quote if you like it.


I approached this from the standpoint of learning javascript. 
So instead of using an API to generate quotes I didn't like all that much, I found ones I liked and stored them in an array.
Utilizing the twitter API was all about understanding the functions available and reading through the documentation to get it working.
